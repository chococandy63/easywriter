Here are some basics that will help you get started.

```md
# This is Title 1

## Title 2

### Title 3

#### Title 4

##### Title 5

###### Title 6

- List Item
- List Item 2
	- Nested List Item
		- More nested Item
		- Yet another more nested item
	- Another nested list item


This is a normal paragraph. You can have **bold text** and *italic text*. You can also creat `inline code block`.
```

Markdown does not care about extra new lines. However, a lack of newlines will not give you desired output. Always leave one blank line after each title, list and paragraph.
